COOKIEMASTER: Alrighty
Igfig: Aye
Igfig: I am Broa Castellar, Knight of the Silver Plate
COOKIEMASTER: Your knees hit the dirt ground but you allow no time to rest as you get back up and run as fast as your cookie legs can carry you. Broa and Toffee are rushing under the cover of night--if the moon hangs above you can't tell through the thick, black canopy.
COOKIEMASTER: Behind you, the screeching of the Witch's shadow minions remind you just how close they are to catching you and it drives you both to run even faster
Igfig: "Crumbs!" I whisper. "They're still after us."
COOKIEMASTER: Suddenly the trees clear from your vision and you are met instead with...a Chasm. Well. That's not much better. You realize now that the dirt below is not actually dirt--it's ash! This land, so close to the Witch's lair, has been charred with hatred and fear.
Igfig: well, as much of a whisper as one can when running at full speed, cookie-heart pounding
Igfig: oh no
COOKIEMASTER: The Minions are still after you...And you are trapped between them, the forest, and this chasm.
COOKIEMASTER: What are you two doing?
Igfig: How wide is the chasm?
COOKIEMASTER: Well, probably not that wide for a person...But you're a cookie. You're not even a foot tall and this chasm is PREEEEEEETTY wide.
COOKIEMASTER: With a bit of a running start you could contemplate jumping but...Well.
Igfig: geez we're almost a foot tall? That's a huge cookie
COOKIEMASTER: The Witch has a big sweet tooth
Igfig: evidently!
COOKIEMASTER: You're more like 7in.
Igfig: ok, that sounds about right
COOKIEMASTER: There's only a small window of time before teh Minions are upon you...You need to think of something.
Igfig: "I don't think we can both jump that... and we won't have time to cut down a tree, either..."
Igfig: "Toffee! Can you stick us to the wall of the chasm?"
Igfig: "I'll use my black shield to camouflage us in the dark."
COOKIEMASTER: Toffee- "Uhh, on THIS side maybe. but once it turns to brittle we'll be stuck!"
COOKIEMASTER: Looking down, Toffee can't see the bottom of this chasm....and not just because it's dark out.
COOKIEMASTER: "You still want to go with that plan?"
Igfig: "Better stuck to a wall than caught in their claws! At least we won't fall."
Igfig: "They're nearly here! Over we go"
COOKIEMASTER: "On it then...!" Toffee, quick as a whip, hocks 4 LARGE spit balls down at the wall. They stick! "Better go now before it hardens!"
COOKIEMASTER: Toffee is first to jump and lands each hand to one glob while it's still sticky
Igfig: I swing down on top of them, pull my shield over us, and cling to the globs for dear life
Igfig: hoping they'll harden before I lose grip
COOKIEMASTER: You both aren't that far down the wall...maybe less than a foot... Well a cookie equivalent to a foot. You slightly slide down the wall further but soon enough the toffee spit hardens and you are both firmly against the wall.
COOKIEMASTER: Above you there comes the shambling of feet...!
COOKIEMASTER: You know they're only shadows, without flesh or bone but that makes their snarling sound all the more terrible.
Igfig: what are they even moving to make that noise? It's unnerving!
COOKIEMASTER: You hold your breath tight, at least you would if you had any, and wait...
COOKIEMASTER: "Sssh...!"
COOKIEMASTER: And then...they turn and head back into the forest.
COOKIEMASTER: You are safe...for now.
COOKIEMASTER: But now you're stuck to the wall of a very...very....VERY deep chasm.
Igfig: (Was there a hidden roll in there?)
COOKIEMASTER: "What now genius...?"
COOKIEMASTER: (Nope, the shadows here aren't that smart. You're fine)
Igfig: (gotcha)
COOKIEMASTER: "If we break the toffee...we could fall."
Igfig: "We aren't too far down... we just need to cover a few inches. Some kind of rope..."
COOKIEMASTER: "I got my whip...but..." Toffee looks up
Igfig: "Can you make a-- ah, perfect"
COOKIEMASTER: There is nothing above them on the wall, like a branch, that he could latch on to.
Igfig: "Just how far can your whip stretch?"
COOKIEMASTER: There were some ashy, charred trees back on the edge but...Toffee can't really see where he'd be aiming if he tried to go for one of those
COOKIEMASTER: And...those trees didn't look  that sturdy, being all burned
COOKIEMASTER: "Pretty far, but it's not as sticky as my toffee spit," Toffee explains
COOKIEMASTER: "I need something to latch onto."
Igfig: "We don't need sticky right now... just some stretch."
Igfig: I pop off an eye
COOKIEMASTER: I assume with the hand you were holding the shield with
Igfig: ...I'd been thinking they could just pop off themselves, but yeah maybe that makes more sense. Stow the shield, break off an eye with my hand
COOKIEMASTER: Toffee carefully frees one hand from the hardened brittle and makes a grab for his whip. "Am I going to have to touch that...? That's sick."
Igfig: "How can you talk like that? This is my CHILD"
COOKIEMASTER: "DUDE I DON'T WANNA KNOW"
Igfig: "METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING"
COOKIEMASTER: does the eye wiggle
Igfig: well if it's going to be a useful minion, I figure it can extrude little limbs to move around, yeah?
COOKIEMASTER: This is your eye, Roleplay it a bit
COOKIEMASTER: What does it do, how does your ability work?
Igfig: hold your horses, I'm getting to the rp! Just wanted to confirm that I wasn't exceeding any limits of good taste
COOKIEMASTER: Nope, it's all you for this
Igfig: I envisioned it as being, I pull off an eye with a chunk of my dough attached. I can maybe have it shape itself crudely over the next few seconds, though that's mainly cosmetic
Igfig: after that point, its crust grows over the soft dough and its shape stabilizes
Igfig: and then it can walk around and do stuff.. it's not very big or strong, maybe a centimetre at most
COOKIEMASTER: Can you do this with only one hand?
Igfig: yeah it's pretty soft. I can rest it on Toffee's head while I shape it, if they don't mind
COOKIEMASTER: Toffee is very obviously grossed out while you do this, and can't help squirming the entire while
COOKIEMASTER: "Gross...gross gross gross gross gross...!"
Igfig: "oh come on, this is cute! Aren't you now, little buddy"
Igfig: and it totally is
COOKIEMASTER: Toffee is not convinced. "Are you done yet...!"
Igfig: like a little kirby-shaped thing with one eye
COOKIEMASTER: A Waddledee?
COOKIEMASTER: Anyway, what are oyu planning on doing
Igfig: yes! That's what i was thinking of
Igfig: "Just about hardened... yes, I think it's ready"
Igfig: "Give me the end of your whip"
COOKIEMASTER: "Dude...No."
COOKIEMASTER: This is Toffee's personal item.
COOKIEMASTER: Personal items cannot be used by another cookie
Igfig: ??
Igfig: I can't even touch it?
COOKIEMASTER: The end, perhaps, but not the handle. You didn't specify which end.
COOKIEMASTER: Communicate with your partner
Igfig: by "the end", I did in fact meant the end. Sorry, should have made that clearer, IC and OOC
Igfig: "Not the whole thing! Just the tip. I was going to have my little guy take that end, while you keep hold of the handle."
Igfig: "Is that okay?"
COOKIEMASTER: "Ok..." Toffee, a bit unsure, whips something that shines almost like amber from...somewhere. It looks like just a rod, shiny and almost seethrough but! With a flick of his wrist, something whips out from one end, revealing a long strand of...something that smells deliciously sweet. The whippy part hangs and Toffee juts it towards Broa.
COOKIEMASTER: (hawhaw the little guy takes just the tip)
Igfig: (hoped so much we weren't going there)
Igfig: I extend the little guy towards the dangling blob at the end, and after a try or two he catches hold of it
Igfig: "Here goes," I say, and toss him up onto the top
Igfig: the uh flat area above
Igfig: what's the word
COOKIEMASTER: Thankfully, Toffee did stretch out just enough slack to try and reach the top.
COOKIEMASTER: (uhhh...plateau)
COOKIEMASTER: The little eye is pretty light so this was no problem, He reaches the top
Igfig: (I think that's the entire landform? Clifftop, maybe?)
COOKIEMASTER: (Clearing, lets just go with that?)
Igfig: (Sure)
COOKIEMASTER: (it kinda is?)
Igfig: "Good job!" I call up
Igfig: Now we see how far we can stretch this whip
Igfig: can we make it to the trees?
COOKIEMASTER: "It's a whip--I need to flick it if you want any more length," Toffee says, "And I don't know how much your....little....buddy will like that."
COOKIEMASTER: Are you using your waddledee to look around?
Igfig: "...very small flicks?" I'm clearly grasping at straws a little bit
Igfig: Aye, I'm having it take a better look at what's up there. Now that we have time for a proper gander
COOKIEMASTER: Alrighty! Through your waddledee's eyes, you see the platform better now that you're not being actively chased. The full moon is above you and it would give you plenty of light...but it's somewhat cloudy this evening. The ground is ash-covered, but frightfully cold. There is no greenery here, but there were those black, barren trees. Thinning and cracked...
Igfig: Any good-sized rocks? Precariously balanced, ideally? Or with narrow clefts in em
Igfig: good-sized being, like, slightly larger than the waddledee
COOKIEMASTER: Then there's the dark forest you came out of. The Chasm stretches pretty far around and you'd need to go further to see what's around, and...yeah! There are a few rocks here and there, though you wonder how well they'd hold your weight given the ashy ground.
COOKIEMASTER: "oh!" Wait I have an idea!" Toffee exclaims
Igfig: Doesn't need to hold our weight, just enough to hold the end in place while Toffee whips it
COOKIEMASTER: "I...I think if I lob a few spit balls, I can use them to kinda...somersault myself up?"
COOKIEMASTER: Presumably, you relay what your waddledee sees to Toffee
Igfig: naturally
Igfig: "You'd need to get out from under me, without either of us falling..."
Igfig:  does that seem doable, at this angle?
COOKIEMASTER: "You can stay here--I can try to get up and once I do I can hang my whip down for you to climb--How does that sound?"
COOKIEMASTER: "I'd need maybe...two or three spit spots to hold at the most."
Igfig: "Can you give me another blob to stand on first? I think I'm only being held up by you and this one in my left hand, right now..."
COOKIEMASTER: "Feet or hand?"
Igfig: "Feet, please"
COOKIEMASTER: Toffee looks down and takes aim, and spits out two blobs just beneath Broa's feet. "Might wanna wait until it hardens before you try standing on them," he warns.
Igfig: "Good point." I take his advice; we can wait a bit longer, sure
Igfig: and so, once it hardens...
COOKIEMASTER: "...Alright, well...Guess it's my turn," Toffee says, visibly nervous at the thought of trying to make the trek up.
COOKIEMASTER: He takes a few spits, and thankfully since you two are only about a 'foot' down, he only need a few spit lobs before he feels comfortable
COOKIEMASTER: Now, actually making his way up--This is now and Obstacle
Igfig: aright
COOKIEMASTER: What Toffee hopes to accomplish is to make a few leaps or flips and attach his limbs to his toffee spit and use each one as another launching platform up until he gets back onto the ledge
COOKIEMASTER: If he succeeds, he does exactly as he wants
COOKIEMASTER: If he fails...He will miss that crucial spit lob and begin to fall down the chasm.
Igfig: If he's going to be jumping... maybe I should take the other end of his whip, instead of leaving it up there with the waddledee?
Igfig: so that if he falls, I can catch him
Igfig: I suggest as much
COOKIEMASTER: Toffee will hold the handle in his mouth, so the waddle should be fine...so long as he doesn't fall.
COOKIEMASTER: Since it's not that much of a distance, I'll say it only cost 2 AP. And we'll focus on Toffee's Chewiness stat.
Igfig: the waddle will be fine either way... but it's not strong enough to hold him if he falls. I would be
Igfig: hold Toffee, I mean
Igfig: or would it just get pulled out of his mouth in that case
COOKIEMASTER: Well Toffee isn't depending on the Waddle, if that's what you mean?
COOKIEMASTER: But since his whip is Toffee's personal item...It's going to act funny in anyone else's hand
Igfig: I'm aware of that, yes. I'm suggesting that I should wrap the end of his whip around my waist or something
Igfig: so that the whip can act as a safety rope if he falls
COOKIEMASTER: Ooohh
COOKIEMASTER: Sure, Toffee can do that before he tries his Approach. I'm guessing little WaddleDee lets go before this?
Igfig: yes, definitely
COOKIEMASTER: Alrighty, lets say we RP'd this BEFORE Toffee made his spits. So they aren't hard now.
Igfig: yes, I don't think he's spat anything yet. You just described what he was intending to do
Igfig: oh, you mean the ones that I'm standing on?
COOKIEMASTER: (This all definitely feels it might run better vocally, especially since I'm running two positions right now--Toffee and 'Game Master'. I think I'm moving a little fast due to knowing what 'Toffee' would want to do.)
Igfig: yeah, I'm sure it would be
COOKIEMASTER: And naw, I meant the ones Toffee would climb
COOKIEMASTER: SO
COOKIEMASTER: Toffee pulls back his whip, after allowing time for Waddledee to get free, and whirls his hand a few times to allow for the whip to stretch and lengthen a good...several feet. Maybe 3 or 4. With another flick, it wraps easily around Broa's waist. It's strangely warm and not as sticky as expected.
COOKIEMASTER: He makes a few spits up, covering the wall and gets ready to jump.
Igfig: "go team"
COOKIEMASTER: Like I mentioned earlier, 2 AP. Toffee's Chewiness against the Obstacle's...which is 4. Toffee has a Chewiness of 6.
Igfig: Oh, so it's actually trivial for him
COOKIEMASTER: Pretty much. If you two were any further down, you might actually have had to worry.
Igfig: right
COOKIEMASTER: There's no roll necessary here, so all 'Toffee' would have to do is Roleplay his success.
COOKIEMASTER: With a heave, he kicks up at the side of the cliff, and starts monkeying his way up the sticky toffee globs and just before they harden...He scrambles onto the ledge, with whip handle clenched in his mouth. Flour, he hopes he never has to do that again.
COOKIEMASTER: He looks around and heads around the nearest tree that looks like it will hold. "Hey Broa! Start climbing!" he calls out.
COOKIEMASTER: (And of course he gets 1AP back)
Igfig: "Here goes nothing..."
Igfig: I am not very chewy, unfortunately
COOKIEMASTER: You are not, but you are only climbing up a whip and not jumping up.
Igfig: aye
COOKIEMASTER: If this were an Obstacle, it'd be based on your strength
COOKIEMASTER: And you got plenty *finger guns*
Igfig: you mean my thicc?
COOKIEMASTER: gawd
Igfig: So I can just heave on up then?
COOKIEMASTER: Go on ahead
Igfig: In that case, I do. I take it slow, just hand over hand and foot over foot. We've got plenty of time now.
Igfig: and soon enough, I'm there at the top with the other two
COOKIEMASTER: "Well...where to now? Those shadow things are still looking for us in the forest."
Igfig: I mop my forehead, wiping away drops of shortening
COOKIEMASTER: "And we're still WAY to close to the Witch's Lair for my comfort..."
Igfig: "Good question..." I look up and down the chasm. Can we see either end?
COOKIEMASTER: Either end? Like left to right or???
Igfig: yeah
Igfig: I'm assuming not, but well maybe there's /something/ useful visible further down at least
COOKIEMASTER: The chasm, and the forest, stretches far on either side. There's nothing you can glimpse out without heading in either direction. Across however, you do see another landmass across the chasm. And...it's also covered in forest.
COOKIEMASTER: You are definitely in a forested area.
COOKIEMASTER: But unlike what you imagine a forest would be, if you were any normal little cookie, it's all...too quiet
COOKIEMASTER: There is no animal life here at all, and that might honestly be for the best.
COOKIEMASTER: You two are quite tasty.
Igfig: is this a full-sized forest, or a cookie-scale forest
Igfig: I'm guessing the latter, or else the fragile trees wouldn't be so much of a problem
COOKIEMASTER: Well given the Witch is a full-sized humanoid, it SHOULD be a 'full-sized' forest. But...something's clearly off about that. There are trees that are towers tall, and trees that only tower over you by several feet. Weeds, long since burned, of every length. Is this because of the Witch's magic? The the land is twisted in this way?
COOKIEMASTER: You...can't answer that.
Igfig: oh, strange indeed!
COOKIEMASTER: ho ho!
COOKIEMASTER: Good on you for asking
COOKIEMASTER: That's how you learn ;D
Igfig: That's the sort of thing that's a little surprising to not have noticed unprompted... but I suppose it *was* very dark in there 
COOKIEMASTER: And being chased
Igfig: yup
COOKIEMASTER: You only just escaped a few hours ago, and before now you knew only the Witch's kitchen...and oven
COOKIEMASTER: You know way too much about her oven.
Igfig: The chasm was "potentially jumpable with a running start", right? So a couple feet, about?
COOKIEMASTER: Mmnn...In the Cookie's perspective lets say....just under 7 feet.
COOKIEMASTER: lol i totally used my desk to imagine the distance
Igfig: Oh, only seven feet? I, Ig, can jump that far, and I'm not exactly a buff jumpman
Igfig: We can make that easy! Probably
COOKIEMASTER: You can try
Igfig: Let's keep the whip tied around my waist, if it has enough slack
Igfig: and then I'll jump right over that wide boy
Igfig: assuming it's a thicc roll
COOKIEMASTER: Toffee hasn't shrunken the whip yet, so it's still a few feet. Less than the chasm though.
COOKIEMASTER: Maybe an inch thick at the base, but thins out at the end
Igfig: how long can he get it? I'm probably too heavy to get moved if he whips it longer
COOKIEMASTER: Toffee looks at this whip and tries to think. "I don't know...I'm pretty close to my limit," he says, "If I stretch it anymore it starts to harden and gets difficult to work with. I got maybe two more feet?"
Igfig: hmm, okay then. Not going to be enough
Igfig: And while I'm thick enough to get over the chasm without much trouble, Toffee might not be
COOKIEMASTER: In the far distance, you hear something howl...But it's not really a howl. It's like the prongs of a fork making one long scratch across a plate!
COOKIEMASTER: It's the Shadows! They're still far off, but...do you really want to bet that it'll stay that way for long?
Igfig: aright buddy, looks like I'm throwing you
Igfig: "<
COOKIEMASTER: "WAIT WHAT"
Igfig: "My throw plus your jump is better than just your jump alone! Simple math"
COOKIEMASTER: "THAT'S NOT MATH. THAT'S NOT MATH AT ALL!"
Igfig: "Well SORRY I don't know your REAL math! I'm just a cookie!"
Igfig: "...Maybe if you spit some stickies on to your hands, you'll have a chance of catching yourself if you fall short?"
COOKIEMASTER: "Well...Yeah...And I think the trees on that side are closer so I coul--YOU WILL WANT TO THROW ME ACROSS A CHASM."
Igfig: "YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA? They're on their way!"
Igfig: "I'll throw little buddy here first if you like"
Igfig: and then I do
COOKIEMASTER: "UGH! NO JUST...." Toffee groans out, taking another peek at the chasm...and shuddering. "You...You better throw me real good!"
Igfig: "As good as I can, Toffee. As good as I can."
COOKIEMASTER: "THAT'S NOT HELPING."
COOKIEMASTER: So now this would be an Obstacle :'Y
Igfig: "WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD"
Igfig: yepp
Igfig: My thicc is 6
COOKIEMASTER: What's your Approach/What you Hope to accomplish?
COOKIEMASTER: We need a new fucking word
Igfig: Size
Igfig: Chunkiness
Igfig: Denseness
Igfig: anyway
COOKIEMASTER: gawd
Igfig: Hmm... probably the best way to get distance on a person-shaped object is to grab them by the feet and throw them like a hammer, eh?
Igfig: ...that is probably incredibly wrong
COOKIEMASTER: a hammer???
COOKIEMASTER: do you normally throw hammers
Igfig: like the olympic sport
COOKIEMASTER: there's a hammer???
COOKIEMASTER: Do you mean a discus or a spear?
Igfig: https://www.google.ca/search?q=hammer+throw&tbm=isch
Igfig: it's related
COOKIEMASTER: holy shit it's a thing
COOKIEMASTER: ANYWAY. YOUR APPROACH?
Igfig: fuck it yeah I'm gonna do it like that anyway. Because it's cool
COOKIEMASTER: I can't really give you advice here. And...Toffee is a bit too terrified to think
COOKIEMASTER: He keeps a hold of his whip, however, now freeing you in case he needs to make an emergency grab.
Igfig: oh yeah for sure he should take his whip back from me
COOKIEMASTER: lolol
Igfig: the tip I mean
Igfig: I swing Toffee until I get up a good bit of speed, give him some time to get used to the momentum, and count down from three
COOKIEMASTER: Okay, so what you hope to accomplish is to ...hammer throw Toffee across the chasm and hope he makes it safely to the other side.
Igfig: and on zero, let go and let the centrifugal force carry him across
Igfig: yep
COOKIEMASTER: If you succeed...yeah, you'll have a screaming Toffee but he'll make it across more or less
COOKIEMASTER: If you fail...He falls.
COOKIEMASTER: This Obstacle will be a test of your strength, Your 6 against the Obstacle's 7.
Igfig: Aright
COOKIEMASTER: however, Toffee himself has got a good Crust on him--He is not that light of a cookie.
Igfig: Even if he falls, he still has a chance
Igfig: oh
Igfig: I thought that;d be more thickness-based, but ok
Igfig: crust too
COOKIEMASTER: You will suffer a 2 point dent in your stat
Igfig: is this like negative help then?
Igfig: ah
COOKIEMASTER: But...y'know you had a real good character moment earlier.
COOKIEMASTER: It was unexpected and the moment showed something about your characters--It was a good RP moment. I'm giving you a +2 for RP.
COOKIEMASTER: So...still 6 against 7.
Igfig: heh, aright!
COOKIEMASTER: So that's an 80% chance to succeed, time for the roll.
COOKIEMASTER: 1d10 DOES BROA CHUCK THAT TOFFEE
Fortuna: COOKIEMASTER, [4] DOES BROA CHUCK THAT TOFFEE = 4 
Igfig: phew
COOKIEMASTER: You did not drop the Toffee, good on you!
COOKIEMASTER: Now chuck him.
COOKIEMASTER: Chuck that screaming boi.
Igfig: I chuck him significantly more than even a woodchuck would be able to chuck
Igfig: if Toffee were wood
COOKIEMASTER: Wait shit forgot to mention AP cost
COOKIEMASTER: LOL
COOKIEMASTER: It was a 4, you get 2 back.
Igfig: and a woodchuck, could chuck
Igfig: Aright!
Igfig: ...where does it say in the rules how many AP we start with?
Igfig: oh, foun dit
COOKIEMASTER: Should be near the end part of the yeah
Igfig: maybe should mention in the "baking a character" section too, that's where I was looking at first
Igfig:  13 left
COOKIEMASTER: Toffee is sent SCREAMING across the chasm--he can't help himself HE WAS JUST SPUN AND LAUNCHED ACROSS A DEEP DARK NOTHINGNESS
COOKIEMASTER: And land face first into the dirt...he tumbles a bit, maybe cartwheels. But he makes it without any damage
Igfig: whee
COOKIEMASTER: Still laying flat in the ground, he raises and arm and gives you a thumbs up from the other side
Igfig: I return the gesture, though I don't know if he can even see it
Igfig: and start winding up for my own big jump
COOKIEMASTER: He does not
Igfig: because that scream is gonna get the shadows coming straight this way
COOKIEMASTER: Oh it sure does
Igfig: Back up, limber up those limbs, crack my neck
Igfig: and then start running full tilt at the cliffedge
Igfig: gonna long-jump it to try to get to the other side
COOKIEMASTER: Now see--I'd say this would be base off your Chewiness
COOKIEMASTER: Speed and Agility and all
Igfig: huh
Igfig: that's actually a good point
Igfig: standing jump might be strength, but yeah this is more about speed isn't it
COOKIEMASTER: Yeeeep.
COOKIEMASTER: Y'know, lets say it's a mix. Strength and Speed.
COOKIEMASTER: So that above is your approach, yes?
Igfig: If you really want it to be a mix, sure... but I greased my own pan, I'm fully prepared to be baked in it
COOKIEMASTER: HAH
Igfig: can Toffee throw me a whip-tip to grab or something? So I just smash face-first into the wall on the other side instead
Igfig: swinging on it I mean
Igfig: ...that's pretty impractical, isn't it
COOKIEMASTER: That depends if you put forth your approach yet. Since this is a playtest and we're writing this, I'm asking. Otherwise, I would have said it's too late for you to ask.
Igfig: well, I'd have said that I was putting forth my approach earlier when I described my run-up... but at the time I didn't know what kind of action that would be, and thought Broa more capable at this kind of thing than he knows himself to be
Igfig: so if you're okay with having a general rule of letting people change their approach if they realize that it wouldn't work as they imagined, sure
Igfig: but if not... well, I've still put it forth I think
Igfig: if we couldn't do a whip thing... I'd probably do something else entirely
COOKIEMASTER: Well, if you say you want to take an Approach and describe it first...then I'd say you have room to rethink. If oyu go ahead and start the approach then...
COOKIEMASTER: Now, I said it was too late for you to ASK
Igfig: ah
COOKIEMASTER: Toffee can help at any point. But by starting your action, you simply couldn't ask IC
Igfig: yeah, that's fair
Igfig: In that case
COOKIEMASTER: You'f have to rely on the other ROleplayer to be intuitive
COOKIEMASTER: So this is the Approach we're going with--You jumping and hoping to make it across?
Igfig: well actually, I was thinking instead...
Igfig: As Broa approaches the chasm, he slows down and stops.
Igfig: "...I don't think I can make this jump after all, actually."
COOKIEMASTER: Alrighty then
Igfig: "Looks like I'm stuck on this side. And there's no time to find another way."
Igfig: "Toffee, I'm glad I could make it this far with you."
COOKIEMASTER: ( Class is about to end and I need to drive wtf are you doing
Igfig: "But from here on, it looks like you're going to be on your own."
COOKIEMASTER: aha omh
Igfig: "I'll keep them busy as long as I can"
Igfig: "which means... GET UP AND RUN"
Igfig: (space for response here)
Igfig: Broa takes a deep breath, and then starts running parallel to the chasm
Igfig: and screaming his little orange-scented head off
COOKIEMASTER: Y'know what, that is a completely valid option to take
Igfig: "OH NO, WHAT EVER WILL I DO? I'M A DELICIOUS LITTLE COOKIE AND I'M COMPLETELY ABOUT TO BE CAUGHT BY SHADOWS"
Igfig: and once they catch up
Igfig: I'll settle in
Igfig: and give them the best the Silver Plate can serve
Igfig: this cookie... is going to bite back
COOKIEMASTER: one sec gotta ask prof quesiton about business plan project
Igfig: kay
Igfig: I think that's probably a good ending point anyway, because it's well past my bedtime
Igfig: gonna go brush my teefs
COOKIEMASTER: lolololol
COOKIEMASTER: ig has a bedtime
COOKIEMASTER: Alrighty, a few things to cover--Clear up Stats more, is one
COOKIEMASTER: Better fine tune the act of Taking an Approach versus if you're just Roleplaying
COOKIEMASTER: For example, if you hadn't jumped yet I'd have no reason to see you don't change your approach even if I give you the Obstacle's Stats
COOKIEMASTER: I just need to say that's what will happen more clearly
COOKIEMASTER: This game definitely flows more smoothly by playing vocally
COOKIEMASTER: Doing the Equation doesn't take much time to do in practice, and I say in a thematic sense of you against the Obstacle it makes sense...but do you still feel it doesn't work for the game?
COOKIEMASTER: Definitely add AP talk to the stats and later have it's own section still
COOKIEMASTER: Also we didn't get to meet Grandma Pizelle
Igfig: The equation worked better in play than I'd been fearing... the fact that rolls are so few and far between definitely helps
Igfig: I think it'll be a bit harder to use once we start getting into help-as-dice
Igfig: but that'll be even less common
COOKIEMASTER: Definitely depends on the help being given, as some acts wouldn't require it
Igfig: Also, another point in favour of keeping the stats and difficulties on the same scale: easier to do things like PVP, or comparing a monster's strength to one's own
COOKIEMASTER: Yeeep
Igfig: I think
Igfig: the main issue for me still
Igfig: is just that the templating, the actual written form of the rule, is still too awkward
COOKIEMASTER: yeeeaaaah
COOKIEMASTER: That's on me
Igfig: so I'll take some more time to drill down and see if I can improve it further
Igfig: ...but not until probably friday
COOKIEMASTER: And I'd say if we were in the heat of battle or something, the rolls would happen more frequently in a short amount of time.
COOKIEMASTER: But that'sll be for another day
Igfig: yeah
Igfig: aright, bed for me. Good game! and good night
COOKIEMASTER: I had two main inspirations for the whole thing
Igfig: oh?
COOKIEMASTER: Q System, which I saw on the Third Wheel--I watch their Pathfinders game every week--And Armello
COOKIEMASTER: Armello is why I decided on percentages
COOKIEMASTER: u should play with me and delf and viv sometime. It was on sale a little bit ago i think 8'Y
COOKIEMASTER: Oh no sale is done
COOKIEMASTER: It was 40% off
Igfig: I actually bought it, yeah! I just don't have time in evenings because time zone and work
COOKIEMASTER: YEEEE
COOKIEMASTER: well fuq
Igfig: But mechanics that work in video games and mechanics that work in tabletop are very different beasts
Igfig: uh so to speak
COOKIEMASTER: S'what tweaking is for, yeah?
COOKIEMASTER: Anyway NIGHT NIGHT
Igfig: indeed
Igfig: NIGHT
